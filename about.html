      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
        Hope Paws is a non-profit animal rescue organization dedicated to giving abandoned, 
        abused, and stray animals a second chance at life. We provide shelter, food, medical care, 
        and adoption services to dogs and cats in need. Our goal is to build a compassionate 
        community where every animal feels safe and loved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in 2020, our rescue team works tirelessly with volunteers, veterinarians, and 
        loving families to rehome animals. With your support, we can continue to make a difference 
        in their lives.
